# CS-255-Module-8-Submission
A GitHub submission assignment for CS 255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was a business named DriverPass that wanted to design a system that would enable users to easily sign up for and 
request driver training across many different devices and operating systems while supporting employees with information entry 
and retrieval tasks.

What did you do particularly well?
Design considerations involving using a website focused design for mass compatibility and the associated supporting hardware. 
I feel that the diagrams were succinct and easy to understand.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The class UML diagram could be more expansive to incorporate more of the overarching system design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs based on a transcript that was provided for the assignment. I tried to interpret design goals as 
literally as possible based on the transcript. It is important to consider the user's needs for the purpose of ethical and legal 
software development. Would the development of a mobile application that would enable GPS tracking for customer pickup for driving 
lessons be an excellent feature and design goal? Absolutely, but the customer isn't necessarily at a business stage where they 
should overinvest in potentially unnecessary software. This feature wasn't specifically requested so the design steers away from 
such an implementation.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I believe that in all business arrangements both parties should be mutually benefitted in order to achieve stable, long term 
agreements and potentially be in a position to recommend each other to other parties, as opposed to one party feeling like they 
are 'getting taken for a ride' or are going with the 'lesser evil' or cheapest one. I think that rational, intelligent people 
should be presented with options with a concise listing of pros in cons or given recommendations in good faith. In this respect,
I feel that software designers should try to limit the scope of the project if certain features are not strictly necessary and 
earnestly try to design systems that are low-risk and as future-proofed as reasonably possible.
